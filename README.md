# Strucutre Displacement

## Brief Review

## How to use
 You will need some Fortran compile to execute all the scripts, you can get [GNU Fortran Compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/) using :
 > sudo apt-get install gfortran
 
 and you can fortran compile the source code using:
 
  > gfortran finite_elements.f95 -o finite_elements

## Run a Calculation

You can run a calculation inserting your parameters into the **main.py** file.

### Mesh Definition

After the creation, the mesh will be showed, initialy it will show the strucutre before the structure displacement, as the  **Figure 01** shows. when the calculations are finished a new mesh will appear, this time it will ilustrate how was the structure before and how is it after the force has been apllied
